This repo collects together all the currently active SynthLab projects as submodules

- [HagiwoMixer](HigawoMixer/): a PCB version of Hagiwo's Eurorack mixer - completed so as to learn how to have PCBs manufactured
- [HagiwoClockMultiDivide](HagiwoClockMultiDivide/): a PCB version of Hagiwo's Clock Multi Divide Eurorack module - completed so as to learn how to have PCBs manufactured
- [EuroAvalanche](EuroAvalanche/): a schematic and PCB layout for a Eurorack module based on a reverse avalance oscillator - completed so as to learn how to have PCBs manufactured
- [EuroTubeScreamer](EuroTubeScreamer/): an attempt to turn a simple distortion pedal design into a Eurorack module
- [vcv_daisypatch](vcv_daisypatch/): a fork of a DaisySP project
- [VaseProtoPlugin](VaseProtoPlugin/`): a fork of a project which uses the DaisySP library to build VCVRack plugins, which I adapted to become a simple delay-line plugin called DaisyDelay (`delay_line_params` branch)
- [DaisyDelayHardware](DaisyDelayHardware/): the beginnings of a schematic for the hardware version of the VCV Rack DaisyDelay plugin (see above)

# Still to add / make
- PhaserPedal: an attempt to produce a protoboard soldering plan by KiCad
- AudioDevPlatforms: a set of notes and examples for breadboarding with the Daisy Seed, Arduino Nano (Mozzi), PicoADK, Teensy and flashing the Rebel Witch
- EurorackPCBTemplate: a 6HP template for a Eurorack front panel and main PCB
