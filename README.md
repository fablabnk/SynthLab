This repo collects together all the currently active SynthLab projects as submodules

- vcv_daisypatch: a fork of a DaisySP project
- VaseProto: a fork of a project which uses the DaisySP library to build VCVRack plugins, which I adapted to become a simple delay-line plugin called DaisyDelay (`delay_line_params` branch)
- EuroAvalanche: a schematic and PCB layout for a Eurorack module based on a reverse avalance oscillator
- EuroTubeScreamer: an attempt to turn a simple distortion pedal design into a Eurorack module
- HagiwoEurorackMixer: a PCB version of Hagiwo's Eurorack mixer - completed so as to learn how to have PCBs manufactured
- DaisyDelayHardware: the beginnings of a schematic for the hardware version of the VCV Rack DaisyDelay plugin (see above)
- EurorackPCBTemplate: a 6HP template for a Eurorack front panel and main PCB
- PhaserPedal: an attempt to produce a protoboard soldering plan by KiCad
- AudioDevPlatforms: a set of notes and examples for breadboarding with the Daisy Seed, Arduino Nano (Mozzi), PicoADK, Teensy and flashing the Rebel Witch
