- plugin progess: how far did everyone get? other projects/progress?
- roadmap
- op amp training
- lockable synthlab cabinets

# Roadmap

Issue: using the seed in a Eurorack module requires the following steps:

Using daisy.patch schematic gives us some schematics that we can copy

1. Powering the seed safely from Eurorack power (+-12V)
	 - daisy.patch generates an isolated +5V from Eurorack +-12V
	 - see Power section of [Daisy Patch schematic](https://daisy.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/products/patch/ES_Daisy_Patch_Rev4.pdf)
2. CV inputs
	- Scaling CV inputs (+-5V) to a voltage the seed ADC inputs can take (+0-3.3V)
	- Summing the CV input with the potentiometer
	- see ADC inputs section of [Daisy Patch schematic](https://daisy.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/products/patch/ES_Daisy_Patch_Rev4.pdf)
	- or use two pins and do this in software?
4. Drop Eurorack audio level on the way into the seed and boost it on the way out
	- see 2 x AUDIO_IN_1 circuits (INT_AUDIO_IN_L) on Audio I/O page of [Daisy Patch schematic] https://daisy.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/products/patch/ES_Daisy_Patch_Rev4.pdf
	- don't forget caps on power

- A key factor in all this is understanding/using op amps

5. Stacked PCBS
- project will involve 2 x PCBS on top of each other
- first with front panel components
- second with seed and associated components

# Training projects

To build our skills 
1. Hagiwo Mixer
2. Distortion module w/Jens
3. DaisyDelay hardware version

# Op amp training

Take a simple op amp chip i.e. TL072
Try to use it to boost and attenuate signals
Learn how to use the power supply and oscilloscope
Learn the different basic configurations that an op amp can be used it
	 - art of electronics
Simulate the same thing using KiCad (v8)

# Next Week

- soldering the Mixer kits
- jam edition / open house
