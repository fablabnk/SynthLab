A rough plan for today...

# All: Get familiar with VCV Rack and our Synth Hardware

- Setup Neutron + some other bits 
- Go through some modular synthesis basics
- Use example of Neutron Bucket Bridge Delay section

# Team 1: Code

## 1. Follow the VCV Rack plugin development tutorial
## 2. Develop your own plugin, without any DaisySP code yet
## 3. Now using DaisySP code, following this template (https://github.com/fablabnk/VaseProtoPlugin)

Inspiration: https://github.com/abluenautilus/SeasideModularVCV

# Team 2: Electronics and Fabrication

## 1. Come up with a panel design for our first audio processing module

One example might be:
- audio in
- parameter 1 knob
- paramater 1 cv input
- parameter 2 knob 
- parameter 2 cv input
- a switch or button
- audio out

Choose the exact components we will use

## 2. Use KiCad to:

- draw the panel template and export it as .svg
- this can be used by the code team and also to laser cut our template
Note: you find the footprint for reference

## 3. Laser cut the panel, mount the components, and fit the knobs

# Plan the next sessionxx

Note: I will be gone for the next two weeks...
